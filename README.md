Controls:
Arrow keys to move the snake.
C to play again after losing.
Q to quit after losing.
How the game works:
Game Window: The screen is 600x400 pixels, and the game is controlled using the arrow keys.
Snake Movement: The snake moves in the four cardinal directions, and its body follows the head.
Food: The snake eats food (represented by a green square). When the snake eats food, it grows longer.
Collisions: If the snake runs into itself or the borders of the screen, the game ends.
Score: The score increases every time the snake eats food. The score is displayed at the top-left of the screen.
Restart or Quit: When the snake crashes, you can choose to restart the game by pressing "C" or quit by pressing "Q".
